# 🎰 Raffle Smart Contract (Production Upgrade Roadmap)

A decentralized, automated lottery system built with Solidity and Foundry, leveraging Chainlink VRF for verifiable randomness and Chainlink Automation for trustless execution.

---

## 📌 Current State (v1 - Functional Prototype)

This contract is a **fully working decentralized raffle system** with the following capabilities:

### ✅ Core Features
- Users enter raffle by paying ETH
- Players stored on-chain
- Automated winner selection using Chainlink VRF v2.5
- Time-based execution using Chainlink Automation
- Automatic payout to winner
- Contract resets for next round

---

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

### 🔁 Flow
1. `enterRaffle()` → users join
2. `checkUpkeep()` → verifies conditions
3. `performUpkeep()` → requests randomness
4. `fulfillRandomWords()` → picks winner + pays out

---

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

- Unit tests using Foundry
- VRF mock integration
- Event emission verification
- Time manipulation (`warp`, `roll`)
- Winner payout validation

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- Scripted deployment using Foundry
- Chainlink VRF subscription creation + funding
- Consumer registration handled automatically

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations

- ❌ Incorrect entrance fee validation logic (`>=` instead of `<`)
- ❌ Single winner only
- ❌ No refund mechanism
- ❌ No emergency controls (pause/kill switch)
- ❌ No round history tracking
- ❌ Push-based payout (reentrancy risk surface)
- ❌ Limited frontend query support

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy (Upgrade Direction)

This project is evolving from:

> **Working Prototype → Production-Grade Protocol**

### Focus Areas:
- Security-first design
- Gas efficiency
- Fault tolerance
- Observability (events + state)
- Extensibility

---

## 🛠️ Upgrade Roadmap

### 🔹 Phase 1: Stability & Bug Fixes
- Fix entrance fee validation logic
- Add strict input validation
- Standardize revert patterns

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Feature Enhancements

#### 🎯 Multi-Winner Support
- Select multiple winners
- Flexible reward distribution

#### 📜 Raffle History
Store previous rounds:
- Winner
- Prize
- Timestamp

#### 👥 Player Constraints
- Max players per round
- Optional per-wallet limits

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Security Hardening

#### 🔐 Reentrancy Protection
- Use `ReentrancyGuard`
- Consider pull-payment model

#### 🛑 Emergency Controls
- Add `pause()` / `unpause()`
- Circuit breaker pattern

#### 🧱 Access Control
- Introduce `Ownable` / `AccessControl`

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Economic & Game Design

#### 💰 Dynamic Entry Fee
- Adjust based on demand or round size

#### 🎲 Weighted Entries (Optional)
- Higher ETH → higher win probability

#### 🪙 Protocol Fee
- Small fee for sustainability

---

### 🔹 Phase 5: Gas Optimization

- Reduce storage writes
- Pack variables efficiently
- Evaluate array vs mapping tradeoffs

---

### 🔹 Phase 6: Advanced Testing

#### 🔥 Fuzz Testing
- Randomized inputs
- Edge case discovery

#### 🔁 Invariant Testing
Ensure:
- No stuck funds
- Valid state transitions

#### 🌐 Fork Testing
- Simulate real Chainlink environment

---

### 🔹 Phase 7: Observability & UX

Add helper view functions:
- `getNumberOfPlayers()`
- `getTimeRemaining()`
- `getCurrentPrizePool()`

Improve events:
- Round start/end
- Prize distribution

---

### 🔹 Phase 8: Production Readiness

#### 📦 Upgradeability (Optional)
- Proxy pattern (UUPS / Transparent)

#### 🔗 Multi-Chain Support
- Config-based deployments

#### 🧾 Documentation
- Full NatSpec coverage
- Developer-facing docs

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

| Layer       | Purpose               |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Unit        | Function correctness  |
| Integration | Contract interactions |
| Fork        | Real-world simulation |
| Fuzz        | Random robustness     |
| Invariant   | System guarantees     |

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision

Transform into a **modular raffle protocol**:

- Pluggable randomness providers
- Configurable game logic
- DAO governance
- Frontend + analytics dashboard

---

## 📍 Development Strategy

- Build **one feature at a time**
- Write tests **before implementation**
- Refactor after validation
- Keep contracts maintainable and modular

## 🧠 Final Note

This is more than a raffle.

It’s a system designed to master:
- Oracle integrations
- Automation systems
- Secure fund handling
- Protocol-level engineering

> Treat every upgrade like it’s going to mainnet.
